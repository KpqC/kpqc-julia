## Local portability changes

The bundled SMAUG-T sources use unsigned intermediate arithmetic in
`native/third_party/SMAUG-T/src/dg.c`,
`native/third_party/SMAUG-T/src/indcpa.c`, and
`native/third_party/SMAUG-T/src/poly.c` to preserve the reference
implementation's 16-bit results without relying on undefined signed left
shifts. The SMAUG-T fixed-weight sampler also uses size-correct loop indices to
avoid signed/unsigned comparison warnings without changing algorithm outputs.
